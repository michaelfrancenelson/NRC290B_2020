## iClicker Question `r colorize(i, "blue")` `r i = i + 1`

I want to compare fish weights in three lakes.  I've sampled 32 fishes from each lake.

What statistical analysis should I perform?

\begin{enumerate}[A]
\item \texttt{Multiple linear regression}
\item \texttt{t-test}
\item \texttt{one-way ANOVA}
\item \texttt{Chi-square test}
\end{enumerate}

## Announcements

This week's material builds on ideas from pairwise group comparisons.

The ANOVA material is more *dense* than what we've covered up until this point.

We're going to have to work on our *statistical intuition* to master these *inferential statistics* concepts.






## This week

Tuesday: Differences between more than two samples: 

- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) concepts
    - One-way ANOVA
    - Two-way ANOVA
    - Multipe testing

Thursday

- Continue ANOVA concepts
- Statistical analysis of salamanders




## Moving beyond two groups

T-tests are great, but what if we need to analyze more complicated scenarios?

Let's walk through some sampling and experimental scenarios to build intuition.


Scenario context: We're interested in bluegill population densities in Massachusetts lakes.

## Scenario `r colorize(i, "black")`

Having just analyzed some fish counts data in 16 lakes in Massachusetts, Thorsten found a significant 'lake' effect using an ANOVA, i.e., the mean number of fish was not the same in all lakes. 

1. Thorsten wants to know which *which lakes are different from each other*.
    - Think carefully: what does this actually mean? 
    - What is the sampling unit?
    - What did he measure?
    - What would he need to compare?



## Scenario `r colorize(i, "black")`

Having just analyzed some fish counts data in 16 lakes in Massachusetts, Thorsten found a significant 'lake' effect using an ANOVA, i.e., the mean number of fish was not the same in all lakes. 

2. What would Thorsten do to find out *which lakes were different from eachother*?

\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{0.5cm}A.]
  \item[A)] A series of $t$-tests
  \item[B)] A Tukey Honest Significant Difference test 
  \item[C)] A Kruskal-Wallis test
\end{enumerate}



`r i = i + 1`
## Scenario `r colorize(i, "black")`

I am interested in testing whether there is a significant difference between the population sizes of fish in 30 **low salinity** lakes and 30 **high salinity** lakes: 

1.  What is different from the last scenario?
2.  What is the sampling unit?
3.  What specific question(s) should I ask?
4.  What, specifically, do I want to compare?





## Scenario `r colorize(i, "black")`

I am interested in testing whether there is a significant difference between the population sizes of fish in 30 **low salinity** lakes and 30 **high salinity** lakes: 

5. Which statistical test could I use?

\begin{enumerate}[\hspace{0.5cm}A.]
  \item[A)] A $t$-test
  \item[B)] A One-Way ANOVA 
  \item[C)] A Chi-square test
  \item[D)] A Two-Way ANOVA
\end{enumerate}

6. Which is the test statistic for the test I chose?




`r i = i + 1`
## Scenario `r colorize(i, "black")`

I am interested in testing whether there is a significant difference between the population density of fish in 30 **low salinity** lakes and 30 **high salinity** lakes. 

In fact, I actually sampled 10 **large**, 10 **medium**, and 10 **small** lakes in each of the high and low salinity lakes. 

I want to explore whether there are differences in population size based on lake **salinity** and lake **size**. 

1. How has our sampling scheme changed?
2. What is the sampling unit?
3. How has our question changed?

  \item[A)] A $t$-test
  \item[B)] A One-Way ANOVA 
  \item[C)] A Chi-square test
  \item[D)] A Two-Way ANOVA
\end{enumerate}

5.  Now which is the test statistic for the test?




## Comparing differences - two samples

Two samples:

- Which test do we use?

\pic{-3}{-0.5}{6.5}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "QM.png")`}
\pic{2}{-1}{5}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "boxXY.pdf")`}




## Comparing differences - two samples

Two samples:

- the t-test?
- test whether group means differ significantly
- $H_0$: there is no significant difference between the means
- $H_1$: there is a significant difference between the means

\pic{3}{-2.2}{4.5}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "boxXY.pdf")`}




## Comparing differences - two smaples

Two samples:

- the t-test?
- test whether group means differ significantly
- $H_0$: there is no significant difference between the means
- $H_1$: there is a significant difference between the means

\vspace{0.5cm}

Significance based on:

- t-statistic: $t = \frac{|\bar{x}_a - \bar{x}_b |}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_a}{n_a}+\frac{s^2_b}{n_b}}}$
- degrees of freedom
- *p*-value

\pic{3}{-2.2}{4.5}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "boxXY.pdf")`}




## Comparing differences - more than two samples

What about if there are more than 2 samples?

- can you think of any examples?

\pic{0}{-0.6}{7}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "QM.png")`}




## Comparing multiple groups - examples

Regional differences in salamander abundance:

- comparing multiple populations
- quantify the differences between populations

\pic{0}{-2}{5}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "ANOVA", "multipop.jpg")`}



## Comparing multiple groups - examples

Plant growth related to available resources (pot size):

- comparing multiple treatments
- quantify the effects of resource availability

\picOver{0}{5}{-2}{3.75}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "ANOVA", "pot.jpg")`}




## Comparing multiple groups - examples

Plants productivity (dry mass in grams) related to fertilizer treatment

- do our treatments influence biomass production?
- is there a positive effect relative to a control?

\picOver{0}{5.5}{-2.5}{3.1}{`r here("slides", "slide_images", "ANOVA", "pots.png")`}




## Comparing multiple groups - examples

When there are more than 2 groups

- t-test is probably not optimal:
   - We would need to do all possible pairs.
   - We might get spurious differences just by chance.  Why?

## ANOVA explained

The ANOVA partitions the *total* variation into *within* sample (group) variation with *between* sample (group) variation to determine whether samples come from a single distribution or not.

## ANOVA and the Sums of Squares

- *Total* sums of squares ($SS_T$)

$$SS_T = \sum(x - \bar{x})^2$$

## ANOVA and the Sums of Squares

- *Within-sample* sums of squares ($SS_W$)
- add up the within sample SS

$$SS_W = \sum(x_1 - \bar{x}_1)^2 + \sum(x_2 - \bar{x}_2)^2 + \sum(x_3 - \bar{x}_3)^2$$

## ANOVA and the Sums of Squares

- *Between-sample* sums of squares ($SS_B$)
- add up the differences in the means

$$SS_B = n_1 (\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x})^2 + n_2 (\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x})^2 + n_3 (\bar{x}_3 - \bar{x})^2$$

## ANOVA degrees of freedom

If we define the following:

- $n$ is the total sample size (number of observations)
- $g$ is the number of groups/samples




## ANOVA degrees of freedom

If we define the following:

- $n$ is the total sample size (number of observations)
- $g$ is the number of groups/samples

Then the degrees of freedom ($df$) are:

- Total: $df_T = n-1$
- Within: $df_W = g-1$
- Between: $df_B = n-g$





## ANOVA the *mean square*

The mean square ($MS$) is the sum of squares divided by the degrees of freedom:

$$MS = SS/df$$

So:

- Total: $MS_T = SS_T/df_T$
- Within: $MS_W = SS_W/df_W$
- Between: $MS_B = SS_B/df_B$

Hypotheses:

When do we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?




## ANOVA the $p$ value

    - all means are equal
- $H_1$: there are significant differences between the means

When do we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis?

- if $F$ is large, then $p$ is small
- if $p<0.05$ we reject the null hypothesis
- if $p>0.05$ we *fail to* reject the null hypothesis




## Pairwise comparisons with ANOVA

The $F$ statistic tells us whether there are differences, but *not* what the differences are:

- *Cannot* use *t*-tests to make pairwise comparisons
    - multiple *t*-tests will lead to significant results by chance




## Pairwise comparisons with ANOVA

The $F$ statistic tells us whether there are differences, but *not* what the differences are:

- Instead we conduct *Post-hoc* testing
    - Tukey Honest Significant Difference test (Tukey HSD)
    - accounts for multiple tests being conducted
    - calculation of a *t*-statistic
    - a pair, so degrees of freedom is 1

## ANOVA Recap

Comparing differences between >2 groups using ANOVA

- Essentially comes down to:
    - a model with one mean *or* a model with a mean per group
    - which model best explains the data
    - which model \underline{significantly} reduces the sums of squares

## More than one factor with ANOVA

So far we have looked at multiple levels within a single factor

- factor: a single categorical predictor variable
- level: the categories within a factor

In some cases, we may be interested in >1 factor

- 2 factors: *two-way* ANOVA
- 3 factors: *three-way* ANOVA
- $\cdots$ multi-way ANOVA




## Two-way ANOVA

Let's use a grazing example:

- Factor 2 (F2): number of levels - 1
- Within: $n$ - (levels in F1 $\times$ levels in F2)
- Total: $n$ - 1

## Group Exercise - *salamANOVA*

We will conduct three analyses using the *salamANOVA*. We are interested in whether salamander snout-to-vent length (SVL) varies by sex and/or site. The data look like this:

```{r}
str(sals)
```

\normalsize

- `Site`: there are four sites (`P1A`, `P1B`, `P2A`, `P2B`)
- `Sex`: `M` (male) and `F` (female)
- `SVL`: the snout-to-vent length in mm




## Group Exercise - *salamANOVA*

Analysis 1: Does SVL vary by sex?

- What is the null hypothesis?
- Make a plot to visualize the hypothesis.
- What statistical test will you use to test $H_0$?
- What is the:
    - test statistic for this particulat test (e.g., $t$, $F$, etc)
    - degrees of freedom (calculate this)
    - significance level
- Conduct the analysis:
    - what is the value of the test statistic
    - what the $p$-value
- Write a short paragraph reporting the conclusion, use values from the statistical test to suppo, supported by the results from the test.
