## Correlations

We need a way to

- quantify correlations/relationships
- assess whether correlations/relationships are *significant*

## Correlations

We need a *test*!

1. Spearman's rank test ($r_s$)

    - determine the strength of the link between 2 samples
    - data are *not* normally distributed
    - realtionship not linear
        - but still exhibits a positive of negative trend
        - is not u-shaped or n-shaped
    - use the *ranks* of values
    - correlation strenght ranges from -1 to 1
        - -1: perfect *negative* correlation
        - 1: perfect *positive* correlation
        - 0: no correlation

## Correlations

We need a *test*!

2. Pearson's product moment  ($r$)

    - determine the strength of the link between 2 samples
    - data *are* normally distributed
    - relationship assumed to be linear
        - positive of negative trend
        - not u- or n-shaped
    - use actual values
    - correlation strenght ranges from -1 to 1
        - -1: perfect *negative* correlation
        - 1: perfect *positive* correlation
        - 0: no correlation

## Correlations

1. Spearman's rank test ($r_s$)

    - determine the strength of the link between 2 samples
    - data are *not* normally distributed
    - not neccesarily linear
    - use the *ranks* of values

2. Pearson's product moment  ($r$)

    - determine the strength of the link between 2 samples
    - data *are* normally distributed
    - assumed to be linear linear
    - use actual values

- For both, the *correlation coefficient* ranges from -1 to 1
    - -1: perfect *negative* correlation
    - 1: perfect *positive* correlation
    - 0: no correlation

## Example: the Mayfly data

\vfill

```{r}
head(mayfly)
```

{\includegraphics[height=3in]{`r here::here(tmp_dir, "spearMayfly.pdf")`}};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the hypothesis

Before conducting any statistical test, we need to state the hypotheses!

- $H_0$ (the *null* hypothesis):

\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
\node[yshift=2cm,xshift=-2cm] at (current page.south east)
{\includegraphics[height=2in]{`r here::here(img_dir, "QM.png")`}};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the hypothesis

Before conducting any statistical test, we need to state the hypotheses!

- $H_0$ (the *null* hypothesis):

*There is no correlation between stream speed and mayfly abundance*

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the hypothesis

Before conducting any statistical test, we need to state the hypotheses!

- $H_0$ (the *null* hypothesis):

*There is no correlation between stream speed and mayfly abundance*

- $H_1$ (the *alternative* hypothesis):

\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
\node[yshift=2cm,xshift=-2cm] at (current page.south east)
{\includegraphics[height=2in]{`r here::here(img_dir, "QM.png")`}};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the hypothesis

Before conducting any statistical test, we need to state the hypotheses!

- $H_0$ (the *null* hypothesis):

*There is no correlation between stream speed and mayfly abundance*

- $H_1$ (the *alternative* hypothesis):

*There is a positive correlation between stream speed and mayfly abundance*

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the statistical test

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

- programs (`Excel` and `R`) will do the math for us
- \underline{BUT} we should be aware of what's going on!

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the statistical test

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

- programs (`Excel` and `R`) will do the math for us
- \underline{BUT} we should be aware of what's going on!

```{r}
mayfly
```

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the statistical test

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

- first, calculate the *ranks* of the values: speed

```{r,echo=FALSE}
mayfly$Speed.rank <- order(mayfly$Speed)
```

```{r}
mayfly
```

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the statistical test

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

- first, calculate the *ranks* of the values: abundance

```{r,echo=FALSE}
mayfly$Abundance.rank <- rank(mayfly$Abundance)
```

```{r}
mayfly
```

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the statistical test

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

- then, calculate the difference in the *ranks*: $D$

```{r,echo=FALSE}
mayfly$Diff <- mayfly$Abundance.rank - mayfly$Speed.rank
```

```{r}
mayfly
```

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the statistical test

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

- then, square the difference in the *ranks*: $D^2$

```{r,echo=FALSE}
mayfly$Diff.sq <- mayfly$Diff^2
```

```{r}
mayfly
```

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - the statistical test

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

- so now we have all the pieces!
    - $n$: number of pairs of observations (each has an $x$ and a $y$)
    - $D$: difference in ranks between variables
    - $D^2$: the difference squared

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - in practice

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

```{r}
mayfly
```

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - in practice

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

$$r_s = 0.81$$

What does this tell us?

\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
\node[yshift=2cm,xshift=-2cm] at (current page.south east)
{\includegraphics[height=2in]{`r here::here(img_dir, "QM.png")`}};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - in practice

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

$$r_s = 0.81$$

Two useful pieces of information:

1. Sign of the correlation
    - positive value means *positive* correlation

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - in practice

$$r_s = 1 - \frac{6 \times \sum D^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}$$

$$r_s = 0.81$$

Two useful pieces of information:

1. Sign of the correlation
    - positive value means *positive* correlation
2. Strength of the correlation
    - $r$ ranges from -1 to 1
    - $r_s = 0.81$ is *strongly* positive
    - but is this *significant*?


## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - conclusions

As with many statistical tests, determine significance based on:

- *significance level*
- *sample size*
- *critical value*

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - conclusions

As with many statistical tests, determine significance based on:

- *significance level*
- *sample size*
- *critical value*

If the test statistic is \underline{greater than} the critical value:

- *reject* the null hypothesis
- there *is* a statistically significant positive correlation

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - conclusions

As with many statistical tests, determine significance based on:

- *significance level*
- *sample size*
- *critical value*

If the test statistic is \underline{greater than} the critical value:

- *reject* the null hypothesis
- there *is* a statistically significant positive correlation

If the test statistic is \underline{less than} the critical value:

- *fail to reject* the null hypothesis
- there is no evidence of a statistically significant positive correlation

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - mayfly conclusions

- *significance level* (typically 5%)
- *sample size* (number of pairs = 8)
- *critical value* (0.738)
- *test stasistic* ($r_s = 0.81$)
- the *test stasistic* is \textcolor{blue}{??} than the *critical value*

\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
\node[yshift=3cm] at (current page.south)
{\includegraphics[height=2in]{`r here::here(img_dir, "spearTab.jpg")`}};
\end{tikzpicture}

## Spearman's rank test ($r_s$) - mayfly conclusions

So, $r_s > 0.738$:

- \textcolor{blue}{reject} the null hypothesis
- \textcolor{blue}{accept} the alternative hypothesis

There *is* a statistically significant positive correlation between stream flow and mayfly abundance!

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$)

The linear assumption:

- relationship between two variables can be described by the equation of a straight line:

$$y = mx + c$$

- $y$: the dependent/response variable
- $x$: the independent/explanatory variable
- $m$: the *slope* of the relationship
- $c$: the *intercept*

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - an example

Relationship between area \& species richness (by hand/eye):

$$species = m \times area + c$$

NOTE: the hypotheses remain the same, but the assumption about the data are different. The assumptions determine the appropriate model!

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - the straight line

Equation of a straight line:

$$y = mx + c$$

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - the slope

Equation of a straight line:

$$y = \textcolor{blue}{m}x + c$$

Calculating the slope:

$$\textcolor{blue}{m} = \frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}$$

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - the intercept

Equation of a straight line:

$$y = mx + \textcolor{blue}{c}$$

Calculating the slope:

$$m = \frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}$$

Calculating the intercept:

$$\textcolor{blue}{c} = \bar{y} - m\bar{x}$$

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - the linear equation

Equation of a straight line:

$$y = mx + \textcolor{blue}{c}$$

- programs (`Excel` and `R`) will do the math for us
- \underline{BUT} we should be aware of what's going on!
    - calculating the *slope* from the data
    - calculating the *intercept* from the data

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - the statistical test

Equation of a straight line: $y = mx + c$

- but, is the linear relationship *significant*?
- we can calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient

$$r=\frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}  {\sqrt{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 \sum (y-\bar{y})^2}}$$

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - the statistical test

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - the statistical test

Equation of a straight line: $y = mx + c$

- we can calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient

$$r=\frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}  {\sqrt{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 \sum (y-\bar{y})^2}}$$

$$r = 0.84$$


## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - in practice

$$r=\frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}  {\sqrt{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 \sum (y-\bar{y})^2}}$$

$$r = 0.84$$

Again we have two useful pieces of information:

1. Sign of the correlation
    - positive value means *positive* correlation
2. Strength of the correlation
    - $r$ ranges from -1 to 1
    - $r_s = 0.84$ is *strongly* positive
    - but is this *significant*?

- *significance level* (typically 5%)
- *sample size* (df = number of pairs - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6)
- *critical value* (0.707)
- *test stasistic* ($r = 0.84$)

## Pearson's product moment  ($r$) - mayfly conclusions

So, $r > 0.707$:

- \textcolor{blue}{reject} the null hypothesis
- \textcolor{blue}{accept} the alternative hypothesis

There *is* a statistically significant positive correlation between stream flow and mayfly abundance!

## Mayfly conclusions

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient:

- $r_s > 0.738$:
- \textcolor{blue}{reject} the null hypothesis
- \textcolor{blue}{accept} the alternative hypothesis

Pearson's correlation coefficient:

- $r > 0.707$:
- \textcolor{blue}{reject} the null hypothesis
- \textcolor{blue}{accept} the alternative hypothesis

Conclusion:

- same regardless of assumptions!
- there *is* a statistically significant positive correlation between stream flow and mayfly abundance!

## Correlations in practice

- we *could* do it by hand (UGH!)
- we *prefer* to use built in functions
    - in `Excel`
    - in `R`

## Example: the Mayfly data

## Group exercise: salamander length correlations

Correlations in `R`:

1. Read in the data
2. Make a plot of 'total length' in response to 'SVL' length
3. Decide whether to use the Pearson or Spearman test

## Group exercise: salamander length correlations

Correlations in `R`:

- Read in the data
- Make a plot of 'total length' in response to 'SVL' length
- Decide whether to use the Pearson or Spearman test
- Conduct the analysis:
    - what is the correlation coefficient?
    - what is the intercept of the relationship?
    - what is the slope of the relationship?
    - is the relationship significant?

## Group exercise: salamander length correlations

Correlations in `Excel`:

- Create an Excel worksheet that show the same values you got in `R`:
    - the correlation coefficient
    - the intercept of the relationship
    - the slope of the relationship
    - the $p$-value

## Group exercise: salamander length correlations

Correlations in `Excel`:

- Create an Excel worksheet that show the same values you got in `R`:
    - the correlation coefficient
    - the intercept of the relationship
    - the slope of the relationship
    - the $p$-value (see below)
- **Submit the workbook**

To compute the $p$-value, you need to use `T.DIST.2T()` in Excel. This needs $t$,  *test statistic*, which you can calculate that using $r$ (the correlation coefficient):

$$t = \frac{r \times \sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-r^2}}$$
