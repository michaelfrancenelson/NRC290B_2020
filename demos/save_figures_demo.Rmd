This is a simple tutorial on how to save a plot as an image file in R/RStudio.






# Creating a figure

Suppose I have loaded the salamander into a variable called `mander`.

```{r}
head(mander)
```


I'll make a conditional boxplot of SVL by Site and Sex: (don't worry if you don't know what that means yet).

```{r}
ggplot(mander, aes(x = Sex, y = SVL, fill = Site)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Salamander Snout to Vent Length")

```






My RStudio session will look something like this:

![r session](../figures/mander_svl_boxplot.png)



# Save the figure method 1

Notice that above the plot there is a button that says *Export*.
Click there and choose whether you want to save the image as a `.pdf` or `.png` file.


# Save the figure method 2

You can also save a figure directly using code in R.  I prefer this method becuase you can more easily specify the options that you want to use for the image.

The image will be saved as the `filename` that you provide.  The image will be saved in your **current working directory**.

The syntax is slightly different than what you're used to.  You have to use `png()` on the line before your plotting code.  You have to place `dev.off()` on the line after your plotting code.


```{r, eval = FALSE}

# This tells R to start an image file:
png(filename = "salamander_boxplot.png")

# These lines create the plot.
# You won't see the plot in the RStudio plot window.
ggplot(mander, aes(x = Sex, y = SVL, fill = Site)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  ggtitle("Salamander Snout to Vent Length")

# This tells R to finish creating the image file and save it.
dev.off()
```

`png()` has lots of options (see the help entry).  For example, you can specify the height and width of the output image (in pixels).

I'll now have a file called **salamander_boxplot.png** in my current working directory.

The best way to learn is to try it!
