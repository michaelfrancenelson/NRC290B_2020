#  Practical Exercise - NRC 290b
#  Introducing the beast that is the water vole A. amphibius
#
#  Like the last exercise, the aim of this practical is to 
#  reinforce some of the essential functionality of R that we
#  will use throughout the rest of the course. 
#  
#  1. Work though the questions in your groups.
#
#  2. Annotate this script as much as you like to keep track 
#     how you answered the questions 
#
#  3. Submit the completed script to Moodle. We will run your 
#     code and will be looking for:
#     - no errors
#     - the results from the code as answers to the questions
#     - the resulting plots as answers to the questions
#
# To begin, go to the moodle and download the 'voles' data - 
# it's called 'voles.trapping.csv'. 
# Save the data somewhere sensible (I suggest your current 
# working directory) and let the fun begin!!
#

# Read in the vole data and call it whatever you want

voles <- read.csv("in_class_activities/voles_1/vole.trapping.csv")

# Print out a summary of the data frame (hint: summary())


# How many observations are there in the data?


# How many variables are there in the data?


# Make a histogram of percent vegetation ('PercVeg')


# Make a box-and-whiskers plot of vole count ('Voles')


# Make a scatterplot of voles and percent vegetation
