DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10003.001

Name: Breeding landbird point counts

Description: Count, distance from observer, and taxonomic identification of breeding landbirds observed during point counts

NEON Science Team Supplier: TOS

Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's breeding landbird sampling. Breeding landbirds are defined as “smaller birds (usually exclusive of raptors and upland game birds) not usually associated with aquatic habitats” (Ralph et al. 1993). The breeding landbird point counts product provides records of species identification of all individuals observed during the 6-minute count period, as well as metadata which can be used to model detectability, e.g., weather, distances from observers to birds, and detection methods. The NEON point count method is adapted from the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR): Field protocol for spatially-balanced sampling of landbird populations (Hanni et al. 2017; http://bit.ly/2u2ChUB). For additional details, see protocol [NEON.DOC.014041](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.014041vF): TOS Protocol and Procedure: Breeding Landbird Abundance and Diversity and science design [NEON.DOC.000916](http://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/NEON.DOC.000916vB): TOS Science Design for Breeding Landbird Abundance and Diversity.

Brief Design Description: Depending on the size of the site, sampling for this product occurs either at either randomly distributed individual points or grids of nine points each. At larger sites, point count sampling occurs at five to fifteen 9-point grids, with grid centers collocated with distributed base plot centers (where plant, beetle, and/or soil sampling may also occur), if possible. At smaller sites (i.e., sites that cannot accommodate a minimum of 5 grids) point counts occur at the southwest corner (point 21) of 5-25 distributed base plots. Point counts are conducted once per breeding season at large sites and twice per breeding season at smaller sites. Point counts are six minutes long, with each minute tracked by the observer, following a two-minute settling-in period. All birds are recorded to species and sex, whenever possible, and the distance to each individual or flock is measured with a laser rangefinder, except in the case of flyovers.

Brief Study Area Description: This sampling occurs at all NEON terrestrial sites.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.

NEON observational systems (OS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv

The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information.

General conventions, used for all data products:
   NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.

   DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).

   SITE: a four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code.

   DPL: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level;

   PRNUM: a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog).

   REV: a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product. The REV value is incremented by 1 each time a major change is made in instrumentation, data collection protocol, or data processing such that data from the preceding revision is not directly comparable to the new.

   HOR: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one horizontal plane. For example, if five surface measurements were taken, one at each of the five soil array plots, the number in the HOR field would range from 001-005. 

   VER: a three-character designation, referring to measurement locations within one vertical plane. For example, if eight air temperature measurements are collected, one at each tower vertical level, the number in the VER field would range from 010-080. If five soil temperature measurements are collected below the soil surface, the number in the VER field would range from 501-505. 

   TMI: a three-character designation, referring to the temporal representation, averaging period, or coverage of the data product (e.g., minute, hour, month, year, sub-hourly, day, lunar month, single instance, seasonal, annual, multi-annual). 000 = native resolution, 001 = native resolution (variable or regular) or 1 minute, 002 = 2 minute, 005 = 5 minute, 015 = 15 minute, 030 = 30 minute, 060 = 60 minutes or 1 hour, 100 = approximately once per minute at stream sites and once every 5-10 minutes at buoy sites (lakes/rivers), 101-103 = native resolution of replicate sensor 1, 2, and 3 respectively, 999 = Sensor conducts measurements at varied interval depending on air mass, 01D = 1 day, 01M = 1 month, 01Y = 1 year.

Other related data products (by sensor, protocol, or variable measured):

Protection of species of concern: At most sites, taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed', i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published. 

Obfuscation of Personnel Information: At times it is important to know which data were collected by particular observers. In order to protect privacy of NEON technicians while also providing a way to consistently identify different observers, we obfuscate each NEON personnel name by internally linking it to a unique string identifier (e.g., Jane Doe=ByrziN0LguMJHnInl2NM/trZeA5h+c0) and publishing only the identifier.

ADDITIONAL REMARKS
------------------

Queries for this data product will return data collected during the date range specified for brd_perpoint and brd_countdata, but will return data from all dates for brd_personnel (quiz scores may occur over time periods which are distinct from when sampling occurs) and brd_references (which apply to a broad range of sampling dates). A record from brd_perPoint should have 6+ child records in brd_countdata, at least one per pointCountMinute. Duplicates or missing data may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before joining tables. Taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed'; see data package readme files for more information.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
